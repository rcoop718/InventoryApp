# InventoryApp

The app developed is an inventory management system designed to assist users in tracking and managing inventory items efficiently. The primary goal was to create a user-friendly tool that automates inventory tracking, alerts users to critical inventory levels, and provides a seamless experience for managing inventory-related tasks. The app includes several essential screens and features to support user needs, such as an Inventory List Screen for viewing and managing inventory items, an Item Detail Screen for displaying detailed information and editing capabilities, and an SMS Settings Screen where users can opt-in for SMS alerts. A notable feature is the automated alert system that sends SMS notifications to users when an inventory item's quantity falls to zero, thereby enabling timely restocking and efficient inventory management.

The app was constructed using a modular approach, breaking down the functionality into manageable fragments and activities. This not only made code reuse easy but also improved the scalability of the app. Testing played a major role in the development process ensure functionality, uncover bugs, and refine the user interface. During development, getting the recycler view to work as intended was hard. Getting the data from the SQLite database to bind with the inventory items was tricky. I had to learn how to make an adapter that would make the data bindings and update the values as needed. For my mobile app I was particularly successful in demonstrating both the use of a recycler view that can add and delete items from a SQLite database and using a bottom navigation bar for the user to navigate through the app. Both of these feature are used in modern app development so I found it important to incorporate when making an engaging and user-friendly app experience.
